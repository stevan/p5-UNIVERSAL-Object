=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # used exactly as UNIVERSAL::Object is used
    our @ISA = ('UNIVERSAL::Object::Immutable');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You can use this class in the same manner that you would use
L<UNIVERSAL::Object>, the only difference is that the instances
created will be immutable.

=head2 When are instances made Immutable?

Obviously we need to create and initialize the instance before
we make it immutable, it is only after that when we want it to be
immutable. This means that if you need to munge values, or build
values based on the contents of other slots, you should do this
inside a C<BUILD> method, during which the instance will still be
mutable.

The instance will remain immutable throughout it's lifetime up
until the C<DESTROY> method is called. Before delgating to any
C<DEMOLISH> methods the instance will be unlocked. This will
allow you to handle any kind of object descostruction neccesary
before the instance is freed.

=head2 Supported REPR types

This module will attempt to do the right type of locking for
the three main instance types; C<SCALAR>, C<REF>, C<ARRAY>,
C<HASH> and C<CODE>, all other instance types are unsupported
and will throw an error.

=head2 Why Immutability?

Immutable data structures are unable to be changed after they are
created. By placing and enforcing the guarantee of immutability,
the users of our class no longer need to worry about a whole class
of problems that arise from mutable state.

=head2 Immutability is semi-viral

Inheriting from an immutable class will make your subclass also
immutable. This is by design.

When an immutable instance references other data structures, they
are not made immutable automatically. This too is by design.

This means that given the following class:

    package Person {
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        our @ISA = ('UNIVERSAL::Object::Immutable');
        our %HAS = (
            given_names => sub { +[] },
            family_name => sub {  '' },
        );
    }

    package Employee {
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        our @ISA = ('Person');
        our %HAS = (
            %Person::HAS,
            job_title => sub { '' },
        );
    }

Any of the following lines would cause an error about modification
of a read-only value because we are trying to change the values
inside the hashes or add new values.

    my $e = Employee->new;
    $e->{family_name} = 'little';
    $e->{family_name} .= 'little';
    $e->{given_names} = [ 'stevan', 'calvert' ];
    $e->{job_title} = 'developer';
    $e->{misspelled_key} = 0;

However, the following would not cause an error because the C<ARRAY>
reference stored in the C<given_names> slot is not itself read-only
and so can be modified in this way.

    my $e = Employee->new;
    push @{ $e->{given_names} } => 'stevan', 'calvert';

=head2 Immutability after the fact

When this class is used at the root of an object hierarchy, all the
subclasses will be immutable. However, if you wish to make an immutable
subclass of a non-immutable class, then you have two choices.

B<NOTE:> both of the examples below assume that there is not a locally
defined C<new> in your class.

=item Multiple Inheritance

Using multiple inheritance, and putting this class first in the list,
we can be sure that the expected version of C<new> is used.

    our @ISA = (
        'UNIVERSAL::Object::Immutable',
        'My::Super::Class'
    );

=item Role Composition

Using the role composition facilities in the L<MOP> package will result
in C<new> being aliased into the consuming package and therefore have
the same effect as the multiple inheritance.

    our @ISA  = ('My::Super::Class');
    our @DOES = ('UNIVERSAL::Object::Immutable');
    # MOP::Util can be used to performs the role composition

=head2 Compatibility Note

This class requires Perl 5.8.0 or later, this is because it
depends on the L<Hash::Util> module and the C<Internals::SvREADONLY>
feature, both of which were first introduced in that version of Perl.
Since this is an optional component, we have not bumped the version
requirement for the entire distribution, only for this module
specifically.
