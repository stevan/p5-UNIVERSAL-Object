=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a simple base class that provides a protocol for object
construction and destruction. It aims to be as simple as possible
while still being complete.

=head1 SLOT MANAGEMENT

One of the key contributions of this module is to provide a
mechanism for declaring the slots that a given class is expected
to have. These are used in the object construction process to ensure
that all slots are created and initialized.

=head2 C<%HAS>

This is a public (C<our>) package variable that contains an entry
for each slot expected in the instance. The key is the slot's name,
while the value is a CODE reference which, when called, will produce
a default value for the slot.

B<NOTE:>
No inheritance of slot definitions is done between classes, this is
left as an exercise to the author, however it is easily accomplished
with the pattern shown above in the L<SYNOPSIS>.

=head2 C<SLOTS ($class)>

This is an accessor method for the C<%HAS> variable in the C<$class>
package.

B<NOTE:>
If you choose to store the slot definitions elsewhere (not in C<%HAS>)
or store them in a different form (not C<< key => CODE >> hash
entries), it is possible to then override this method to return the
expected values in the expected form.

=head1 INSTANCE REPRESENTATION

=head2 C<REPR>

This returns a new HASH reference to use as the instance.

B<NOTE:>
If you wish to use a different instance type of some kind then you
will need to override this method.

B<NOTE:>
The HASH that gets returned from here will eventually be blessed,
which means you are limited to C<tie> or XS C<MAGIC> based solutions
if you want this HASH reference to behave differently.

=head1 CONSTRUCTION PROTOCOL

Once we know the expected slots it is very easy to create a default
constructor. This is the second key contribution of this module, to
provide a consistent and complete protocol for the construction and
destruction of instances.

B<NOTE:>
The method documentation is meant to be read from top to bottom,
in that they are documented in the same order they are called.

=head2 C<new ($class, @args)>

This is the entry point for object construction, from here the
C<@args> are passed into C<BUILDARGS>. The return value of C<new>
should always be a fully constructed and initialized instance.

=head2 C<BUILDARGS ($class, @args)>

This method takes the original C<@args> to the C<new> constructor
and is expected to turn them into a canonical form, which is a
HASH ref of name/value pairs. This form is considered a prototype
candidate for the instance, and what C<BLESS> and subsequently
C<CREATE> expect to receive.

B<NOTE:>
The values in the prototype candidate should be shallow copies of
what was originally contained in C<@args>, but this is not actually
enforced, just suggested to provide better ownership distinctions.

=head2 C<BLESS ($class, $proto)>

This method receives the C<$proto> candidate from C<BUILDARGS> and
from it, ultimately constructs a blessed instance of the class.

This method really has two responsibilities, first is to call
C<CREATE>, passing it the C<$proto> instance. Then it will take
the return value of C<CREATE> and C<bless> it into the C<$class>.

B<NOTE:>
This method is mostly here to make it easier to override the
C<CREATE> method, which, along with the C<REPR> method, can be
used to change the behavior and/or type of the instance
structure. By keeping the C<bless> work here we make the work
done in C<CREATE> simpler with less mechanics.

=head2 C<CREATE ($class, $proto)>

This method receives the C<$proto> candidate from C<BLESS> and
return from it an unblessed instance structure that C<BLESS> will
then C<bless> into the C<$class>.

First it must call C<SLOTS> (described above), followed by C<REPR>
(also described above) to get both the slot definitions and a newly
minted HASH ref instance. Using these two things, along with the
C<$proto> candidate, we construct a complete blessed instance.
This is accomplished by looping through the list of slots, using
values in the C<$proto> when available, otherwise using the slot
initializers. The final unblessed HASH ref based instance is then
returned.

B<NOTE:>
If you wish to use a different instance type of some kind then you
will need to override this method.

=head2 C<BUILD ($self, $proto)>

The newly blessed instance supplied by C<BLESS> must still be
initialized. We do this by calling all the available C<BUILD> methods
in the inheritance hierarchy in the correct (reverse mro) order.

C<BUILD> is an optional initialization method which receives the
blessed instance as well as the prototype candidate. There are no
restrictions as to what this method can do other then just common
sense.

B<NOTE:>
It is worth noting that because we call all the C<BUILD> methods
found in the object hierarchy, the return values of these methods
are completely ignored.

=head1 DESTRUCTION PROTOCOL

The last thing this module provides is an ordered destruction
protocol for instances.

=head2 C<DEMOLISH ($self)>

This is an optional destruction method, similar to C<BUILD>, all
available C<DEMOLISH> methods are called in the correct (mro) order
by C<DESTROY>.

=head2 C<DESTROY ($self)>

The sole function of this method is to kick off the call to all the
C<DEMOLISH> methods during destruction.
